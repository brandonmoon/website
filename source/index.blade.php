    <p>Hi, I'm Brandon Moon, and I'm a mobile software developer. I currently work with React Native but have done native development for both iOS and Android and love to learn new technologies. I'm also a husband and father to three wonderful children. </p>

    <p>This website is just a place for me to experiment and learn, as well as a convenient place for links when I need them.</p>
